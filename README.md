Do you feel lucky punk is a small web app written in pure Python for learning purposes.
App is starting server on hosts ip address with port 1337.
You can get json response if you visit<a href="/json"> /json</a>.
App is simply scaning our local network and searching for our playstation 3 mac address,if the mac address is not present on network we assume that no one is playing ps3.
And yes I know that the app wont be telling the true if some one leaves ps3 turned on but that's a human error.
